/**
 * Everything the map rollout is watched through, in one place.
 *
 * Three renderers now serve three groups of phones, and only one of those
 * groups is the team's own. So the question is not whether a map crashes, it
 * is which tier a phone landed in, whether it was probed or remembered, how
 * long the map took, and at which stage it gave up. A crash report alone
 * cannot answer any of those.
 *
 * Both sinks are used on purpose, because they answer different questions.
 * PostHog has the player and the counts, so "what share of phones on gl1
 * never see a map" is a query. Sentry has the stack and the device, so "what
 * exactly threw on this one" is a click. The tier is a Sentry tag rather
 * than only an event property, since a tag can be searched and grouped on,
 * which is what turns an unrelated crash into "all of these are grid".
